        <h1>Defining Podcasts:</h1>
        <h2>A Listening List</h2>
        <p>The Reacting to the Past game <i>Defining a Nation: India on the Eve of Independence,
                1945</i> is one in which the students must learn, and then teach one another, highly
            diverse material. The instructor/Game Master will give some introductory lectures, the
            game book gives numerous appendices and essays, and the role sheets--the longest in the
            Reacting universe, to my knowledge--give very extensive descriptions of the historical
            roles and factions. That being said, students may wish for more background on the
            specifics of their roles, and because those roles are so varied, no instructor could go
            into depth on all of them during the setup phase. (Ambitious students may also want to
            do opposition research to prepare themselves to debate their counterparts.)</p>
        <p>Podcasts can help to close that gap. What follows is a curated list of podcasts that
            instructors may wish to assign, or to offer, their students as auxillary teaching
            material. In full disclosure, I have not listened to every one of these, though I have
            listened to many of them, and all, so far as I can tell, come from generally reputable
            sources; and while I am a history professor, modern India is not my field of research.
            But my own students have appreciated having this list available, and so I am happy to
            share it publicly. Further, while most students would only have time to listen to a few
            of these during the semester or during the game, they may develop an interest in the
            field and benefit from having access to this list to assuage their own curiosity after
            the semester is over.</p>
        <p>I would be happy to add to this list, so if you know of any well-informed and balanced
            podcast episodes that are relevant, or if you have more subject knowledge and think that some of those listed here give incorrect information or unduly biased views, please email me at whc7 (at) pitt (dot) edu.</p>

        <h2>Historical background</h2>
        <p>The podcast <a class="inline_disabled"
                href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0sBh58hSTReUQiK4axYUVx" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">Empire</a> did its first season about the British Raj. Episodes 1-5
            are particularly relevant as companion listening to reading the appendix "Unfinished
            Journey" in the game book.</p>
        
        <p>An original newsreel video of the arrival of the delegates to Simla (2 minutes) is available <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUCGMAUfsQs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. This can set the scene well as a "liminal moment", though as the video speaks of the failure of the conference, students need to understand that this only means a temporary deadlock in the proceedings at this moment, which it will now be their job to try to break.</p>

        <p>The Village Leader roles are in a state of evolution and in their various iterations cover a variety of motives, regions, and views. It is hard to pin down specific podcast episodes that would satisfy that diversity. However, if you are using the older version of the role sheets in which one of the papers should be on "When Famine Came To Our Village", the student will find a lot of detail in the BBC podcast series <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/m001wr57"

        <h2>Debriefing</h2>
        <p>Students should probably avoid listening to these until after the game, to avoid the
            temptation to steer in the direction of the historical outcome.</p>

        <p>The National Archives of the UK produced a project aimed at high-school students (I think?) <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/teaching-young-people-about-the-partition-of-british-india-75th-anniversary/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teaching young people about the Partition of British India: 75th anniversary</a>.</p>
        <p>I also found on the website of The National Archives <i>the original declassified 4-page memo from Pethwick-Lawrence to London</i> giving his views on how the Simla Conference ended and why, including specific observations about many of the factions and roles in the game. I have found this an excellent source for debriefing by having students compare and contrast their own, and one another's, actions to those of their historical counterparts. Due to copyright restrictions, I cannot share this file online, but I believe I should be able to email it to fellow instructors upon request.
