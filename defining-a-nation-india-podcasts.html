<h1>Defining Podcasts:</h1>
<h2>A Listening List</h2>
<p>The Reacting to the Past game <i>Defining a Nation: India on the Eve of Independence, 1945</i> is one in which the students must learn, and then teach one another,
highly diverse material. The instructor/Game Master will give some introductory lectures, the game book gives numerous appendices and essays, and the role sheets--the longest
in the Reacting universe, to my knowledge--give very extensive descriptions of the historical roles and factions. That being said, students may wish for more background on 
the specifics of their roles, and because those roles are so varied, no instructor could go into depth on all of them during the setup phase. (Ambitious students may also want 
to do opposition research to prepare themselves to debate their counterparts.)</p>
<p>Podcasts can help to close that gap. What follows is a curated list of podcasts that instructors may wish to assign, or to offer, their students as auxillary teaching material. 
In full disclosure, I have not listened to every one of these, though I have listened to many of them, and all, so far as I can tell, come from generally reputable sources; 
and while I am a history professor, modern India is not my field of research. But my own students have appreciated having this list available, and so I am happy to share it 
publicly. Further, while most students would only have time to listen to a few of these during the semester or during the game, they may develop an interest in the field
and benefit from having access to this list to assuage their own curiosity after the semester is over.</p>
<p>I would be happy to add to this list, so if you know of any well-informed and balanced podcast episodes that are relevant, please email me at whc7 (at) pitt (dot) edu.</p>
