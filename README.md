# Reacting to the Past
This repo holds some interactive html/css/js files that create responsive grading rubrics for Reacting to the Past speeches and papers. I do not claim ownership of this material.
It also includes a curated list of podcasts relevant to the game Defining a Nation: India on the Eve of Independence, 1945.
